\noindent{An individual-based model (IBM) named COSMOSPARK has been developed to simulate the population growth of \textins{Cosmopolites sordidus} in banana fields with associated crops (maize). This model is an extension of the COSMOS model simulating the epidemiology of the banana weevil \textit{Cosmopolites sordidus}, a major pest of banana fields. The cosmos model is based on simple rules for local movement of adults, oviposition of females, development and mortality, and infestation of larvae inside banana plants. COSMOSPARK incorporates adult predation. The model parameter was derived from the analysis of field data and the model was validated on assumptions of significant predation in plots with complex diversity. COSMOSPARK was therefore used to test different spatial arrangements of banana and maize on the growth of \textit{C. sordidus}. Interplanting banana with maize reduced the pest population but also the percentage of banana plants with severe attacks. Our model explains the key factor in the population regulation and epidemiology of this tropical pest.}
